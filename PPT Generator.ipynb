The forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and assumptions. They are subject to certain risks and fluctuations as described in other publications, in particular in the risk and opportunities management section of the combined management report. If these expectations and assumptions do not apply or if unforeseen risks arise, the actual course of business may differ significantly from the expected developments.

The health and safety of our PUMA Family was our top priority, while we executed our strategy to become the world’s fastest sports brand and continued our strong growth momentum.\\nFrom the outset of the war in Ukraine, we focused on our employees, athletes and other partners, providing safe accommodation and welcoming many PUMA employees and their families in Germany and Poland, where we also helped arranging work permits and jobs.\\nWe were impressed by the actions taken by our PUMA Family. Colleagues in Poland and Hungary waited at the borders to bring PUMA employees and ambassadors from Ukraine to safety. Others from our HQ in Herzogenaurach drove to Ukraine to\\nbring necessities such as food and clothes to help those who had stayed in the country. We also gathered product donations for aid organizations in Ukraine to get help to those who needed it most.\\nFor our efforts to provide an attractive workplace, PUMA was named a Top Employer 2022 in several regions of the world, including Europe and Asia/Pacific. We were listed by Forbes among the World’s Best Employers and by the Financial Times as a Leader in Diversity for Europe. In Germany, we were named “Company of the Year” at the German Diversity Awards and in Mexico we were among the best places to work for women in Expansión’s ranking “Súper Empresas Para Mujeres”.\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic eased in Europe and the Americas, but the situation for our store network and our supply chain remained challenging in parts of Asia, especially in China, where our employees did an exceptional job despite the repeated lockdowns. The tireless work of our sourcing teams ensured that supply chain disruptions were kept to a minimum throughout the year.\\nPUMA’s brand heat was boosted further by the great performances of our athletes, who underscored our credibility as a sports brand. At the World Athletics Championships in Eugene, Oregon, USA, Jamaican sprinter Shericka Jackson ran the second fastest 200m time in history, while Swedish pole vaulter Armand “Mondo” Duplantis set yet another world record of 6.21 meters and was named “World Athlete of the Year.” Another gold went to Portuguese athlete Pedro Pichardo in the triple jump with the best performance of the year.\\nOur Ukrainian PUMA athlete Yaroslava Mahuchikh won the gold in the high jump at the World Indoor Championships in Belgrade, Serbia and the European Championships in Munich, Germany. Her win in Belgrade was a very emotional moment, after she took a difficult three-day journey by car at the start of the war in Ukraine to travel to the event in Serbia.\\nOur athletes relied on the latest versions of our evoSPEED NITRO spikes, which are made with PUMA’s NITRO-Technology and a PWRPLATE for extraordinary energy return. NITRO is also an important part of our newest product line-up for long- distance and road running, such as the futuristic FAST-R NITRO Elite and the DEVIATE NITRO ELITE 2.\\nWe also added to our roster of international top athletes in road running, by signing Norwegian Sondre Moen and US athlete Jenny Simpson.\\nIn Football, our PUMA Team Morocco sensationally reached the semifinal of the World Cup in Qatar. Our players Antoine Griezmann, Olivier Giroud and Raphaël\\nVarane were in the French starting line-up in the final. Neymar Jr. scored his 77th goal for the Brazilian national team, equaling the record of football icon Pelé.\\nAhead of the tournament, we kicked off the “Generation Fearless” campaign, as part of which our global teamsport ambassadors presented our new ULTRA and the FUTURE 1.4 football boots.\\nThe Women’s Euro in England confirmed the increasing popularity of women’s football in all markets. With Austria, Iceland, Italy and Switzerland, PUMA had four teams at the tournament and also generated great visibility with the more than 70 players who played in our boots. We equipped our players and teams with special collections and supported them with marketing campaigns ahead of the tournament.\\nAmong club teams, PUMA teams AC Milan and Manchester City both won the title and Olympique de Marseille and Borussia Dortmund came in second in their respective leagues. In the Netherlands, PSV Eindhoven won the Dutch Cup. At the end of the season, PUMA secured a long-term contract extension with AC Milan and became the official match ball provider of the Italian football league Serie A, starting from the 2022/23 season.\\nIn North America, PUMA works with LaMelo Ball, one of the most successful players in the NBA, and we created the very successful signature shoes MB.01 and MB.02 with him, which are sold exclusively at our strategic retail partner Foot Locker. Our basketball athlete Marcus Smart was named NBA Defensive Player of the Year while Jackie Young became the most improved player of the year in the WNBA. We expanded our roster of Basketball ambassadors with new signings such as Mikey Williams, Scoot Henderson and NaLyssa Smith.\\nIn Golf, Cobra PUMA Golf athlete Ewen Ferguson won the Commercial Bank Qatar Masters and the ISPS Handa World Invitational, while Olivia Cowan claimed her maiden Ladies European Tour Victory in India at the Hero Women’s Open. Lexi Thompson took the trophy at the Aramaco series in NYC and once again joined the champions circle. Anna Nordqvist won in the The Netherlands and brought home the Big Green Egg Open. Finally, Justin Suh took his first win at the Korn Ferry Tour Championship, which paved his way onto the PGA Tour and gives him a spot in 2023 at The Players Championship and at the US Open.\\nIn Motorsport, Red Bull Racing driver Max Verstappen secured another Formula 1 Drivers’ Championship, as PUMA supplied the three most successful teams in the sport: Scuderia Ferrari, Oracle Red Bull Racing and Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1. We benefited from the increasing popularity of the sport, especially in the United\\nStates, where Miami hosted its first Grand Prix in 2022, which was immediately sold out.\\nDuring our return to New York Fashion Week, our spectacular FUTROGRADE show included a digital Web3 experience. The runway show was curated by PUMA Creative Director June Ambrose and special appearances on the catwalk by our ambassadors such as Usain Bolt, Winnie Harlow and Yaroslava Mahuchikh created a lot of buzz in the press and on social media. With the FUTROGRADE event, we showed that the virtual world is becoming increasingly relevant for our young audience.\\nIn 2022, we also unveiled our largest Web3 collaboration to date with 10KTF and launched “PUMA and the Land of Games” on the online gaming platform Roblox. We used the Roblox experience for a unique launch event, as we first presented Manchester City’s new third kit in “PUMA and the Land of Games”, giving players the first opportunity to explore and interact with the new kit in the virtual world.\\nIn 2022, we launched our PUMA Shopping App in India, the United States, the UK and Japan. The app allows consumers to virtually try on selected products before they buy, see what the products look like in sophisticated 3D animations and make purchases. PUMA further strengthened its distribution by entering new markets with the PUMA.com online store in the Philippines, Thailand, Peru, Norway, Saudi Arabia and several other new countries in the Middle East and Africa.\\nWe announced a long-term partnership with British-Nigerian rapper, and record producer Skepta, who will design product and be a part of global marketing campaigns. Deals with pop stars Eleni Foureira from Greece and Teodora from Serbia underlined our focus on local relevance to reach audiences around the world.\\nIn September, we invited industry peers, activists, NGOs, experts, ambassadors, and consumers to London for our sustainability event Conference of the People, an open conversation about sustainability, which put the concerns of Gen Z at the center of the debate. It gave us the opportunity to explain our sustainability work in great detail, including the RE:SUEDE and RE:JERSEY circularity projects. For RE:SUEDE, we distributed 500 experimental pairs of our iconic SUEDE sneaker to consumers in Germany, who tested them for half a year before returning them, so we can establish whether the sneakers can be biodegraded in a controlled industrial setting. The RE:JERSEY recycling project was unveiled in partnership with our football teams Manchester City, AC Milan, Borussia Dortmund, Olympique de Marseille and Girona. In this project, we trial a chemical recycling process,\\nwhich can turn old polyester garments into new polyester yarn and even deal with logos, embroideries and club badges. We expect to scale up the use of this chemical recycling process in the coming years.\\nGiven our sustainability efforts, we were honored when industry publication Business of Fashion named PUMA the most sustainable brand in a ranking of the 30 largest companies in the business and when we received the Footwear News Sustainability Leadership Award. These awards are an important confirmation for us that we are on the right track and are making progress with our strategy to make PUMA more sustainable.\\nIn November the Supervisory Board appointed Arne Freundt to become the chairman of the management board and CEO of PUMA SE. Arne Freundt has worked for PUMA for more than ten years, previously as a member of the Management Board and Chief Commercial Officer. He replaced Bjørn Gulden, who left the company after nine years.\\nIn April, the Supervisory Board elected Héloïse Temple-Boyer as Chair of the Supervisory Board at its meeting. Héloïse Temple-Boyer has been a member of the Board since 2019 and is a member of the Audit Committee.\\nThe financial year 2022 was marked by operational challenges due to the continued effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The negative impact of the pandemic in the form of lockdown measures was particularly evident in Greater China, where retail shops had to be temporarily closed. Global goods availability improved significantly due to easing capacity bottlenecks in the logistics industry towards the end of the year.\\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine led to a significant impairment of business in these two countries in the past financial year 2022. At the beginning of the invasion, we suspended all of our retail activities in Russia and Ukraine. As a result, no sales were generated with the respective retail activities, but costs continued to be incurred. In Russia, retail activities remained suspended for the rest of the year. In Ukraine, we were able to resume most of our retail activities over the course of the year on the initiative of the Ukrainian team. Russia and Ukraine’s share of the total sales of the PUMA Group declined from almost 4% in the previous year and was then only 2% in 2022. At the end of the year, retail stores in Russia incurred impairment losses on rights-of-use in the amount of a high single-digit million euro figure. Due to the current situation, our retail activities in Russia remain suspended until further notice. The management team are carefully monitoring the current situation in Russia and analyzing the various possible scenarios and\\nmeasures. In all our considerations, the health and safety of our employees and their families are always our top priority.\\nDespite the uncertain geopolitical and macroeconomic business environment and the continuing negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, 2022 was the most successful financial year ever in the history of PUMA. Based on continued brand dynamics, successful product launches, the best possible service for our retail partners, athletes and consumers and a strong focus on flexibility in business operations, PUMA achieved record sales, operating result (EBIT) and consolidated net earnings in the past financial year.\\nThe ongoing restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic in the Asian markets, especially in Greater China, the crisis in Ukraine and persistently high inflation had a negative impact on consumer confidence and demand in 2022.\\nNevertheless, in the past financial year 2022, PUMA managed to exceed € 8 billion in sales for the first time in the company's history. Currency-adjusted sales increased by 18.9%. In the reporting currency, the euro, this corresponds to an increase in sales of 24.4% from € 6,805 million in the previous year to\\n€ 8,465 million in 2022. In the financial year 2022, PUMA thus managed to surpass the sales forecast for currency-adjusted sales growth in the mid-teen percent range, which had already been adjusted upward during the year.\\nHigher sourcing prices due to raw materials and cost increases for incoming freight, an unfavorable regional and distribution channel mix and increased promotional activities due to the promotional market environment led to a decline in the gross profit margin from 47.9% in the previous year to 46.1% in 2022. These negative effects were partially offset by price adjustments and currency effects. Net expenses from other operating income and expenses increased by a total of 21.0% in the 2022 financial year from € 2,725 million in the previous year to\\n€ 3,296 million. The increase was mainly due to higher expenses for marketing, a higher number of the Group’s own retail stores and higher sales-related distribution and warehousing costs. In addition, PUMA continued to be faced with operational inefficiencies, particularly in the supply chain, due to COVID-19. The weaker increase in other operating income and expenses compared to sales growth reflects the operating leverage achieved. As a result of continued cost control, it was possible to achieve a reduction in the cost ratio from 40.0% in the previous year to 38.9% in 2022.\\nDue to the strong sales growth and continued cost control, the operating result (EBIT) increased by 15.0% in the past financial year from € 557.1 million to\\n€ 640.6 million. The operating result therefore lies within the forecast of a range between € 600 million and € 700 million. However, the EBIT margin decreased from\\n8.2% in the previous year to 7.6% in 2022. The improvement in operating result is also reflected in the development of consolidated net earnings, which improved by 14.2% year-on-year. Consolidated net earnings increased from € 309.6 million in the previous year to € 353.5 million, while earnings per share rose accordingly from\\n€ 2.07 in the previous year to € 2.36. This allowed PUMA to achieve record consolidated net earnings in the financial year 2022 and fully achieve the profitability targets in the past financial year.\\nThe positive net earnings enables the Management Board and the Supervisory Board to propose the distribution of a dividend of € 0.82 per share for the financial year 2022 at the Annual General Meeting on May 24, 2023 via corresponding distributions and profit transfers to PUMA SE. This corresponds to a payout ratio of 34.7% of consolidated net earnings according to IFRS and is in accordance with PUMA's dividend policy, which foresees a payout ratio of 25% to 35% of consolidated net earnings. In the previous year, a dividend of € 0.72 per share was paid out (payout ratio for previous year: 34.8%).\\nAs part of the quarterly index review, the PUMA share has been relisted on the MDAX stock exchange index since December 2022. The PUMA share was previously a member of the DAX since September 2021. After starting 2022 at a price of\\n€ 107.50, PUMA's share price fell to a low of € 43.85 in October 2022. The price of the PUMA share then recovered by the end of the year and rose to € 56.70. This represents a decline in the share price of 47.2% compared with the previous year. The market capitalization of the PUMA Group amounted to around € 8.5 billion at year-end 2022 (previous year: € 16.1 billion).\\n1\\nEquity & Impact\\nReport 2022\\nEquity & Impact Report 2022  Introduction\\nClimate Action\\nDiversity, Equity, Inclusion & Belonging\\nMental Health\\nCivic & Community Engagement\\nResponsible Business & Governance\\nReporting Principles & Data\\n2\\nPsst, you can use this navigation\\nto get around in the report.\\nOr click the links below!\\n01.\\nIntroduction\\nWe are the world’s most popular audio-streaming subscription service, with 489 million Monthly Active Users (MAUs)— including 205 million Premium subscribers—across 184 markets as of December 31, 2022.\\nContinued...\\nNext page\\nThis is Spotify\\nOur Values\\nInnovative: We move\\nfast and we take risks.\\nSincere: We have no\\ntime for internal politics.\\nWe recognize that Spotify has an ability and a responsibility to help create a more equitable and sustainable world for our employees, creators, and listeners.

And to bring in the most effective change we can, we’ve focused our efforts on a set of targeted priority areas that support global efforts in each of our business areas. Those efforts from the past year are explored in detail here, in our 2022 Equity & Impact Report.\\nI’m pleased with our progress across initiatives, especially our continued commitment to providing an experience on Spotify that, while combating harmful\\ncontent, reflects and amplifies the millions of unique\\nand diverse voices and perspectives of all who use our\\nplatform.

Hence, we want to take responsibility to\\ndrive progress in this space and share our journey with\\nour partners and peers. Our current focus is to further\\nmeasure and understand our climate impact along our\\nvalue chain so that we can prioritize the right actions,\\nscale those actions, and collaborate to reduce\\nour footprint.\\nOf course, we are already making changes where\\nwe can, including increasing energy efficiency in our\\noffices, supporting internal climate communities, and\\nupdating our climate-tracking and risk-assessment\\nprocesses.\\nUsing our platform to educate and inspire Our platform is uniquely placed to educate and influence millions of people. During 2022, we continued to create and amplify engaging content on science, stories, and solutions related to the climate crisis. And we seek to provide more perspectives by, for example, elevating the voices of underrepresented groups and young climate champions. Last year, we also continued to make climate-related content more accessible through our Climate Action hub, at live events, and by broadcasting from COP27, the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference.\\nReporting Principles & Data\\nMeasuring & Reducing Our Climate Impact\\nAs a digital platform with limited ownership of physical assets, 98.9% of Spotify’s GHG emissions are Scope 3, which means they fall outside our direct control. We’re teaming up with academics and partners across our value chain to investigate how we can better measure and understand these emissions as we continue our work to set tangible reduction pathways.\\nSpotify’s 2022 GHG emissions\\nIn 2022, Spotify’s total GHG emissions were 391,483 metric tons of CO2e, an increase in absolute terms of 9.9% compared to 2021.

In 2022, as part of our efforts to embed sustainability into our business practices, we prioritized further developing strategies, goals, and processes within our core platform operations—with a focus on our Research\\nDevelopment (R&D) team. R&D-related activities involving cloud and end use are key emission sources for Spotify, thus need to be addressed to reach net-zero.\\nWe also continued to work with, scale, and deepen our climate initiatives across our other operations, striving to reduce emissions related to offices, employees, and goods and services. Keep reading to learn more about climate action for our key emission sources in 2022.\\nCloud and end use\\nIn 2022, we implemented climate-related initiatives for key R&D teams that focus on ways to reduce emissions related to our cloud and end-use activities. These initiatives include prioritizing platform solutions that can reduce emissions per content hour streamed and finding ways to collaborate with partners along our value chain to drive reductions in emissions.\\nNow our focus is to see these metrics rolled out\\nand understood across our business, guided by a\\nstreaming-emissions data model created through our\\nwork with DIMPACT.  DIMPACT  is a collaborative\\nproject that brings together world-class researchers\\nfrom the University of Bristol and several of the most\\ninnovative media and technology companies. This\\nwork has allowed us to better track our emissions\\nreductions and improve efficiency with clear\\naccountability.\\nOur goal is to refine our methodology for measuring\\ncloud and end use in 2023 based on the above\\ncollaboration, and move to a more activity-based\\napproach.\\nMarketing\\nMarketing was a major source of our emissions\\nin 2022. To reduce our marketing emissions, we\\nfocused on understanding them better and exploring\\nways to advertise using more sustainable practices.\\nFor example, with the help of a local charity in Nigeria,\\nwe converted used billboards in Lagos into bags\\nfor local schools. The material is safe to use, and\\nrepurposing it instead of sending it to a landfill helps\\nreduce emissions. We will continue to implement\\nfurther environmental initiatives in 2023 to ensure our\\napproach to marketing aligns with our values.\\nMore key actions\\nNext page\\nKey Actions 2022\\nTravel\\nFollowing two years of decreased travel as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, travel saw a large increase in 2022 as many teams and partners had a need to meet in person. However, we implemented several measures to support more sustainable and less frequent travel. These measures include an updated booking tool that checks whether the trip is necessary and whether other modes of transport have been considered before booking a flight, and it recommends low-emission flight and hotel options first.\\nWorkplaces\\nWe have offices around the globe, and we’re constantly looking for ways to make them more efficient and sustainable. These include the following efforts:\\nEquity & Impact Report 2022                                  Introduction\\nClimate Action\\nDiversity, Equity, Inclusion & Belonging\\nMental Health\\nCivic & Community Engagement\\nResponsible Business & Governance\\nReporting Principles & Data\\nOur existing Sustainable Building Spotify Guidelines has continued to guide our selection and maintenance of offices. We prioritize buildings that are certified by third parties such as LEED, Energy Star, or WELL.\\nOur dynamic space-optimization approach means we can provide the same workplace experience for employees but with less space and, therefore, less impact.\\nOur offices are fitted with sustainable modular furniture and energy-efficient lighting.\\nWe strive to run our offices on 100% renewable electricity. In markets where this isn’t possible, we purchase Energy Attribute Certificates to cover our consumption.\\nWe optimize our water use by installing efficient water fixtures, making thoughtful site selections, aligning with local ecosystems, and managing our discharge responsibly.\\nMeasuring & Reducing Our Climate Impact\\nKey Actions 2022\\nUsing Our Audio Platform to Educate & Inspire\\nOur Employees Take Climate Action\\nCarbon Removal and\\nAvoidance\\nOur primary focus is reducing our negative climate impact and using renewable electricity for our operations.\\nWe complement this work with an impact-first approach to carbon removal and avoidance.\\nIn 2022, some examples of projects we’ve supported include direct air capture, biochar, protection and restoration of nature, and decarbonization advocacy and policy.\\nIn 2023, instead of directly compensating our 2022 emissions, we will contribute to climate projects that deliver decarbonization, nature protection, and carbon removal in line with global climate targets. Through this approach, we seek to support projects with the largest potential long-term and catalytic effects for our planet—whether the solutions are nascent and need investment to scale, or are grassroots organizations like forest protection.\\nUsing Our Audio Platform to Educate & Inspire\\nAs we reach half a billion monthly active users worldwide, Spotify has a responsibility to curate and create climate content. In 2022, we continued to leverage the power of storytelling to inspire, educate, and engage listeners by highlighting the many people and initiatives combating the climate crisis, as well as the ways we can all get involved. On this page we present some examples of content from 2022.\\nIn addition to supporting climate content on our platform, we seek to influence action in society by sharing knowledge through networking, collaborations, and partnerships. The Climate Action Studio, our pop-up podcast format, traveled to Egypt for COP27 to bring inclusive and accessible content from the conference to a wide audience around the world. In 2022, we also hosted climate sessions at local events, such as the Way Out West festival in Sweden.\\nThis content, and much more, has a home in our Climate Action hub, which launched in 2021 in preparation for Earth Day. Since then, it’s become a source of compelling and helpful information about climate change for our listeners.\\nPodcast\\nTwenty seventy-two\\nWritten by Tuva Novotny, Henrik Björn, and Nathalie Álvarez Mesén, and told by Gizem Kling Erdogan, Edvin Ryding, and Maxida Märak, this collection of short stories creatively explores future climate scenarios.

For example, the R&D team now\\nhas dedicated resources who are working\\nto drive emission-reduction initiatives and\\nincrease awareness and skills associated\\nwith climate action. We also added climate\\nresponsibility guidelines to the handbook for\\nour engineering teams. Climate awareness\\nand responsibility now sit alongside other\\nengineering best practices such as reliability,\\ncompliance, security, and cost management.\\nEach year, Spotify arranges a company-wide Hack Week during which our engineers, data scientists, designers, and product managers get the time and space to focus on new ideas that leverage both our technology and the reach of the Spotify platform.\\nThe theme of the 2022 Hack Week was Making the Planet Cooler. Around the world, Spotifiers spent five days coming up with exciting ideas and solutions for climate action, from a green tour planner for artists to a climate footprint calculator for listeners.\\nDuring Hack Week, we also built and released the Cloud Carbon Footprint plug-in for Backstage, our open-source developer portal. The plug-in—which anyone can use for free— helps development teams understand how their cloud usage impacts the environment and what they can do about it.\\n03.\\nDiversity, Equity,\\nInclusion & Belonging\\nWe want a fairer and more equitable society in which\\neveryone’s voices can be heard—whatever their\\nbackgrounds or identities. We live and breathe these values\\nin how we run our business, proactively nurturing a culture\\nof true diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEIB).\\nBy making our business more diverse and inclusive,\\nwe can unlock so much potential for problem-\\nsolving, creativity, and joy. We strive for a workforce\\nthat represents our creators, artists, and consumers,\\nbecause we value different perspectives, experiences,\\nand ideas. For us, we start with inclusive hiring—\\nattracting and hiring from different backgrounds,\\ngenders, races, ethnicities, and identities.\\nBut welcoming diversity isn’t enough. We also\\nneed to foster a culture of inclusion and belonging.\\nThat means integrating our equity principles into\\nthe systems and structures of our organization.\\nIt also means adapting our approach to suit local\\ncircumstances—there is no “one size fits all” solution.\\nIn this chapter, we outline our approach and strategy\\nfor improving diversity, equity, inclusion, and\\nbelonging, both inside Spotify and on our platform.\\nWe also share our priorities and progress.\\nEquity & Impact Report 2022\\nIntroduction\\nClimate Action\\nDiversity, Equity, Inclusion & Belonging\\nMental Health\\nCivic & Community Engagement\\nResponsible Business & Governance\\nReporting Principles & Data\\nStrategy\\nRacial Equity\\nDisability Inclusion Plan\\nWorkforce Representation\\nInternal Tools & Practices\\nCommunity Groups\\nCreators & Contents\\nCreator Equity Fund\\nStrategy\\nWe revamped our strategy for diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging in 2022, prioritizing Racial Equity and Disability Inclusion while still delivering on our broader set of goals. As with all our impact work, we look at the challenges and opportunities through the eyes and ears of our employees, creators, and users.\\nFor our employees, we know that accelerating diversity is not only about hiring. We also need to develop and retain talent—at all levels of our business—as well as invest in a new generation of audio creators and tech professionals.\\nSpeaking the same language\\nWe want everyone to feel they can have open and honest conversations about diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging. That starts with creating a shared understanding of what we mean by those terms. Here are the definition statements we use:\\nDiversity\\nDiversity is the range of unique characteristics, perspectives, similarities, and differences\\nan individual or organization has that shape Spotify’s workplace and culture. These may include national origin, language, race, education, disability, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, age, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, military status, life experiences, mental health, neurodiversity, and family structure.\\nInclusion\\nInclusion is the intentional action to connect each employee to Spotify’s mission and values, and to encourage collaboration, flexibility, and fairness so that Spotifiers from all backgrounds can thrive.\\nBelonging\\nBelonging is the experience of Spotifiers when they are accepted, valued, and trusted as true members of the organization.\\nEquity\\nEquity is the fair and equitable treatment of all Spotifiers, so that everyone has access to the opportunities, systems, and resources needed to do their best work.\\n2022 Highlights\\nReached most of our 5-Star Strategy goals in support of the growth and development of our Black employees, expanded to a Racial Equity Strategy with a global footprint, and added focus in the U.S. on the Latinx/Hispanic community and the Asian American Pacific Islander (AAPI) community.*\\nDeveloped our Disability Inclusion Plan with resources and support for Spotifiers. Centralized guidance on workplace accommodations, making the process clearer and easier. Also created our Disability Inclusion Playbook for managers and made our recruitment process more accessible for candidates with disabilities.\\nWe conducted a DEIB survey in the Nordics to inform plans in the region.\\nWe describe more in the Racial Equity, Inclusive Hiring, Philanthropic Work & Employee Engagement and Frequency sections.\\nRacial Equity\\nIn 2022, we continued to focus on how we attract, hire, and retain people from diverse backgrounds and support them with the tools to thrive. We also focused on making sure everyone feels seen, heard, and valued at Spotify, educating our content teams on inclusive storytelling and building cultural competency\\naround diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging at every level of our business. We started activating our Black equity work in Brazil, the U.K., and Sweden. We also continued to expand our efforts to further drive inclusion, belonging, and retention, amplifying Black, Latinx, and AAPI voices and supporting these communities externally.\\nCreated in 2020, our 5-Star Strategy exists to accelerate our anti-racism and racial equity work, both internally and on our platform.\\nIn partnership with our Belonging Group, BLK, and a cross-functional group of leaders who oversee the implementation of the 5-Star Strategy, we’ve been working collaboratively across business units and global functions to drive our racial equity plans. We do this by focusing activities through five key areas: content, people, culture, giving, and policy.\\nThrough a focus on music and talk, talent, culture, giving, and policy, the 5-Star Strategy has already made a holistic and lasting impact at Spotify and on our listeners and employees.\\nFor our Spotifiers\\nWe hosted our first BLK Workforce Development Conference in two European locations to focus on the support and development of Black Spotifiers in\\nthe region. We also expanded our long-standing U.S. conference to become a truly Americas conference, with presenters from Brazil in our live event in NYC and participants from Brazil joining virtually.\\nWe created a scholarship program in partnership with the United Negro College Fund (UNCF) to create pathways into the tech industry for Black students.\\nWe conducted listening sessions and surveys for the Black community so we can better understand opportunities to increase our support of the community in a meaningful way.\\nFrequency\\nFrequency is our global initiative and holistic destination for celebrating Black art, entertainment, creativity, culture, and community both on- and off-platform. On-platform, Frequency has continued to operate with an always-on approach to support Black artists and creators. Highlights from 2022:\\nHosted Frequency’s Free Studio—a four-day “residency” that provides space and resources for Black creators across various disciplines\\nand mediums.\\nLaunched the SundayDinner series. This documentary film series is a celebration of Black artists and music from different regions. Through conversations over dinner from Black-owned restaurants, the documentary highlights Black regional music making waves in Washington, D.C., Maryland, and Virginia (DMV); California; and Texas. The artists discuss how the region has influenced their craft and what the future of music looks like for their area. This series is an extension of Spotify’s Frequency platform and the Ripple Effect, a playlist series that uplifts Black artists from a regional scope to amplify their cultural power and value beyond their cities.\\nLaunched two three-day song shops, in partnership with Songwriter Producer Relations, for almost\\n30 producers, songwriters, and creators to raise awareness and amplify our Ripple Effect playlists.\\nLaunched the Spotify x PLUS1 for Black Creatives Fund Frequency Scholarship Program, which provides renewable two-year need-based scholarships to Black students attending any accredited college or university who are interested in pursuing a career in music.\\nValuable 500 commitment\\nEquity & Impact Report 2022\\nDisability Inclusion Plan\\nWe launched our Disability Inclusion Plan in\\npartnership with our DEIB Able Belonging Group.

Ultimately, we strive for a workforce that reflects our creators, artists, and consumers, because we value different perspectives, experiences, and ideas at decision-making tables. Inclusive hiring means attracting and hiring from different backgrounds, genders, races, and ethnicities, and from a multitude of identities.\\nOur commitment is unwavering, but our approach will continue to evolve as the business does. Our Diversity, equity, inclusion & belonging (DEIB) team will continue to collaborate with Talent Acquisition and our HR partners to support and drive our efforts to achieve the aspirational inclusive hiring goals we made in 2020.\\nOur future looks bright, and to move the needle on inclusion and diversity, we believe it’s important to cultivate deeper relationships with people from all backgrounds. There are three things we can all do with meaning and intentionality to continue this journey:\\nDiversify our social networks, our neighborhoods, the businesses we frequent, and the partners we work with.\\nSeek out diversity professionally by building diverse professional networks to engage in dialogue, advertise positions, and build meaningful relationships for when the right opportunities arise.\\nEncourage diverse perspectives in everything we do in every room we’re in.\\nLooking ahead, we will reset our aspirational goals from 2023 to 2025 to reinforce these commitments. Establishing aspirational goals focuses our attention, establishes accountability, and drives change and results.\\nInclusive hiring\\nOur inclusive hiring initiative is dedicated to accelerating representation across our business and ensuring that our hiring managers and recruiters have the tools, resources, and support they need to attract and retain diverse talent globally. Our work focuses on the retention and development of underrepresented communities.\\nWe are working toward three key outcomes:\\nCompany-wide understanding of representation and inclusion.\\nBest-in-class practices, processes, and preparation for inclusive hiring.\\nTools and resources for recruiters and hiring band leaders.\\nWorkforce by Gender (Global)\\n53.9% Male   0.4% Non Binary   45.7% Female\\nLeadership (Director+)\\n57.9% Male   0.2% Non Binary   41.9% Female\\nLeadership (VP+)\\n66.0% Male   34.0% Female\\nLeadership (C-suite)\\n55.6% Male  44.4% Female\\nBoard of Directors\\n63.6% Male    36.4% Female\\nRace/Ethnicity (US Only)\\nU.S. government reporting standards\\nEquity & Impact Report 2022\\nInternal Tools & Practices\\nWe believe that being transparent about our workforce\\ndemographics and the opportunities available to\\nSpotifiers is key to creating a culture of diversity, equity,\\ninclusion, and belonging. There are two tools we use to\\nhelp us provide and maintain this transparency.\\nEcho\\nLaunched in 2021, Echo is our Internal Talent\\nMarketplace. Our people can use Echo to find growth\\nopportunities based on their skills, experience, and\\ndevelopment goals. The AI-powered tool also helps\\nband leaders, project owners, and mentors find\\nand connect with talent from all over the world. We\\ndesigned Echo so everyone at Spotify can thrive,\\nbe seen, and access opportunities from anywhere.\\nIn this way, it helps remove biases and ensures that\\nopportunities are inclusive to all. In 2022, we saw our\\nemployees take full advantage of this tool.\\nMore tools & practices\\nEcho in 2022\\nNext page\\nInternal Tools & Practices\\nInterview training and support\\nWe equip our employees, especially our interviewers and hiring managers, with the tools, resources, and training to emphasize inclusivity throughout the hiring process. Our interview training modules provide education on how to make hiring, the recruitment process, and the selection process more inclusive.\\nPay equity\\nSince 2015, Spotify has conducted an annual pay equity review comparing the pay of Spotifiers who are doing “like for like” work. The objective of these reviews is to course correct if needed and ultimately ensure we’re applying equitable pay practices. Pay equity is also taken into consideration when we make any pay decision, like during the hiring process or our compensation review windows.\\nInclusive storytelling training\\nStories have the power to drive real change. We’re focused on sharing narratives that both celebrate and propel diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging. In 2021, we conducted six training sessions in inclusive storytelling for over 200 members of our U.S. marketing team. In 2022, we delivered another 17 training sessions in the U.S., the APAC region, Europe, North America, and Latin America. With these sessions, we spanned our marketing and podcast teams and reached nearly 300 more Spotifiers.\\nWe provide this training to help our teams understand the power of story in changing narratives and creating empathy, and to empower them with the tools and vocabulary to be effective agents of change in their day-to-day work.\\nEarly Career Pipeline\\nWe can position ourselves as an employer of choice by sharing who we are—our brand, culture, and work—with the world. We strive to attract top-notch talent through a focus on access, diversity, equity, and inclusion.

We had three tracks, each of which\\nwas designed to provide general industry advice as\\nwell as insight into career pathing, our products, and\\nour culture.\\nBLK Workforce Development Conference As part of our Global Racial Equity work, we continued our BLK Workforce Development Conference. This year we expanded the event beyond the U.S. to include Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA), and Latin America (LATAM). The EMEA event focused on building community and addressing racism and inequity, and on the intersectionality\\nof the Black experience across the region. We hosted the hybrid in-person and virtual experience simultaneously from our London and Stockholm hubs.\\nThe second conference, once dedicated to the U.S. and now expanded to include LATAM, centered around the theme FWD: Pack Light. The focus was on the intersectionality of the Black experience across the regions, but also on career development and advancement, community, and celebration.\\nBoth regions hosted internal and external speakers who left our audiences with takeaways and tools for the road ahead.\\nBelonging Groups\\nEquity & Impact Report 2022                                  Introduction\\nClimate Action\\nDiversity, Equity, Inclusion & Belonging\\nMental Health\\nCivic & Community Engagement\\nResponsible Business & Governance\\nReporting Principles & Data\\nDiversity, Equity, Inclusion &\\nBelonging Community Groups\\nStrategy\\nRacial Equity\\nDisability Inclusion Plan\\nWorkforce Representation\\nInternal Tools & Practices\\nCommunity Groups\\nCreators & Contents\\nCreator Equity Fund\\nOur 18 Diversity, equity, inclusion & belonging Community Groups (previously Employee Resource Groups) elevate voices of people who are underrepresented in our industry or historically marginalized.

These bi-monthly gatherings provide a friendly space to discuss a range of topics including allyship, representation, inclusive leadership, and gender identity. The virtual events are globally streamed and recorded to ensure that as many employees as possible can engage in discussions.\\nIntro Days\\nIntro Days is a live experience where our new hires gather in Stockholm, where it all started. During three intense days, new employees acquire a sense of our Swedish roots and unique Spotify culture and meet\\nsenior leaders who paint the picture of where we’re from and where we’re going.\\nWe believe that getting together in the beginning of the employee’s career at Spotify positively affects their sense of belonging and connectedness. It accelerates a sense of belonging and an understanding of our culture and how it all connects in the world of Spotify.\\nIn the beginning of 2022—while still unable to travel—we hosted two virtual editions of the event, in February and June, with 681 attending.\\nLater in the year, in August, we had the opportunity to host the largest-ever Intro Days event, live in Stockholm, welcoming 1,950 Spotifiers. We followed that with another event in November, with 850 in attendance.\\nInclusive benefits\\nOffering the right kind of benefits to every employee at Spotify is another way for us to enhance diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging. We do more\\nthan provide standard medical, dental, vision, and retirement plan benefits.

With API artists representing every genre, and in all stages of audio creation, this campaign continues our efforts to create awareness and expand the API community’s presence on Spotify.\\nHouse, we’re working with , an\\norganization that combats the racial and ethnic discrimination targeting Asian American and Pacific Islander communities, which has risen during the COVID-19 pandemic.\\nLo Nuestro es Arte, which features creators in the music, podcast, and visual art spaces who are helping reinforce and affirm Latinx culture—and the work of Latinx creators—as invaluable art.\\nLo Nuestro es Arte aims to celebrate the past, present, and future of the Latinx community and raise awareness of its biculturalism while recognizing its ongoing strength in the face of adversity.\\ntoday, while the Future of Latin anoints the hottest\\nartists on the rise in tropical, regional Mexican, and\\nevery genre in between.\\nFinally, through the Beyond the Music playlist\\ncollection, we amplified the voices of the immigrant,\\nAfro-Latinx, Indigenous, and LGBTQIA+ communities.\\nElevating Underrepresented Creators\\nWe’re committed to identifying and, where possible, removing barriers that make it harder for creators from marginalized groups to flourish. One way we do this is by providing opportunities that support these creators.\\nNextGen\\nNextGen is a Spotify initiative designed to infuse, activate, and grow podcast culture on college campuses. From the program’s inception, Spotify has partnered with the University of Southern California, the University of Pennsylvania, and New York University to offer podcast programming and curriculum to students, allowing us to get closer to an exceptional pipeline of Gen Z talent and storytellers. In 2022, in partnership with the CEF (Creator Equity Fund), Spotify expanded this program  to HBCU campuses across the U.S. Spelman College in Atlanta, Georgia, signed on as our first HBCU partner, inspiring the next class of Black content creators and storytellers and equipping them with tools and resources to develop their podcast skills.\\nPodcasts\\nSound Up\\nSound Up\\nSoundUp  is our global program for empowering the next generation of podcasters through education, tools, workshops, and support. We want to create a space for new voices, stories, and perspectives. In 2022, Sound Up operated in 11 countries, including Mexico, Italy, and Japan. We also supported an additional 120 emerging creators last year (totaling 280 program alumni) and have seen many of our creators go on to release chart-topping content and become full-time podcasters.\\nBehind the Mic\\nBehind the Mic is Sound Up’s career development program to support members of underserved communities who are aspiring to careers as producers, sound engineers, and other behind-the-scenes roles in podcasting.\\nwe announced\\nElevating Underrepresented Creators\\nDiversity and inclusion scholarships\\nBack in 2021, we announced an educational partnership with the prestigious music college BIMM Institute\\nto provide eight fully funded diversity and inclusion scholarships to students from underrepresented backgrounds, with the aim of accelerating diversity in music education and the creative industries.\\nIn 2022,  the first batch of scholarship\\nrecipients, who will each attend one of BIMM’s eight campuses across the U.K., Ireland, and Germany. We recently welcomed the students to our London and Berlin offices to show them a day in the life\\nof a Spotifier and introduce them to their Spotify Music Team mentors. Over the course of 2023, their individual mentors will share insight and guidance for their first steps into the industry. We also supported the wider BIMM student body with a number of opportunities in 2022, including free studio time at our Noteable Studios at Metropolis, London, as well as feedback sessions, masterclasses, and access to Spotify educational resources.\\nIndustry partnerships\\nWe work with partners that help us lead the way\\ntoward a more inclusive and equitable audio industry.\\nIn 2022, those included:\\nADCOLOR: Helps underrepresented groups in creative industries by forming a community of diverse professionals who support and uplift one another.\\nGold House: Nonprofit collective of API founders, creative voices, and leaders working toward more authentic multicultural representation and societal equity.\\nUNCF: Continued our UNCF scholarship program.\\nDuring 2022, we expanded our partnership with\\nADCOLOR to support its Futures Summit, which\\nidentifies and nurtures the next generation of leaders\\nin the advertising, marketing, media, and public\\nrelations industries. We also supported Gold House’s\\nFutures Event, which seeks to address the historical\\nchallenges of API contributions’ being under-\\nsupported and undervalued across various industries.\\nCreator Equity Fund\\nIn February 2022, Spotify established the Creator Equity Fund (CEF), a $100 million investment spanning multiple years, that powers the company’s commitment to uplifting creators who have historically been underrepresented in the audio industry.\\nToday, the CEF team is primarily focused on amplifying Black and LGBTQIA+ musical performers, songwriters, and podcasters in the U.S., the U.K., and Brazil. We believe this is where Spotify will have the most impact given our current footprint and relationships in these markets, but we also think\\nit’s essential to approach the fund with fluidity and flexibility as we strive to elevate emerging creators and reflect the diversity of our world.\\nLooking ahead, the CEF team’s efforts aim to continue supercharging long-standing Spotify programs, introducing new initiatives, and highlighting the next generation of creators.\\nIn CEF’s first year, the team accomplished the following:\\nSupporting the year-round representation of Black and LGBTQIA+ artists through programs like Frequency, AMPLIFIKA, and GLOW.\\nFunding the production and creation of several Black-led podcasts, including those launching new seasons in 2023.\\nHelping expand the Spotify Global Summer Internship program by funding for additional HBCU students to gain experience in audio during the 10-week program.\\nSponsoring a music and arts festival founded to support and amplify LGBTQIA+ creators, artists, and songwriters.\\nThe CEF team will continue to identify and create the right opportunities to support underrepresented artists while approaching its work with fluidity and flexibility as they strive to uplift and amplify the global creator community.\\n04.\\nMental Health\\nWe believe that everyone’s experience of mental health\\nshould be welcomed, respected, and supported. Heart &\\nSoul, our global mental health initiative, is helping us cultivate\\nan open, caring, and stigma-free workplace. And because\\nwe understand the power of music and podcasts, we also\\nsupport our listeners through external initiatives, such as our\\nWellness hub and World Mental Health Day campaign.\\nEquity & Impact Report 2022                                   Introduction\\nClimate Action\\nDiversity, Equity, Inclusion & Belonging\\nMental Health\\nCivic & Community Engagement\\nResponsible Business & Governance\\nReporting Principles & Data\\nWorking Toward Better\\nMental Health\\n3 pillars of\\nHeart & Soul\\nHeart & Soul Ambassadors\\nAccess to Mental Health Support\\nDomestic Abuse Support Program\\nTuning In to Our Spotifiers\\nKey Learnings\\nSupporting Our Listeners\\nRaise awareness and\\nbuild knowledge\\naround mental health\\nand mental health\\nissues.\\nWe want our people to feel they belong at Spotify, no matter what experiences they bring with them. That’s why we decided our diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging team was the true home for Heart & Soul. And because it’s a strategy rather than a program with a start and end date, Heart & Soul is always evolving and finding new ways to drive behavioral and cultural changes at Spotify.\\nMental health has always been important at Spotify, but our journey really took off in 2018 with the launch of Heart & Soul. The initiative has three pillars:\\nRaise awareness and build knowledge around mental health and mental health issues.\\nEnable self-care and professional support so that everyone can find their unique way of taking care of themselves.\\nNormalize the conversation to reduce mental health stigma at work.\\nWe know that the best approach to any health issue is preventive, so we provide the space, opportunities, tools, and resources for our people to seek and receive the support they need.\\nIn 2022, we expanded this work with the launch of our Domestic Abuse Support Program and our Substance Use Awareness and Support Program.\\nEnable self-care and professional support so that everyone can find their unique way of taking care of themselves.\\nNormalize the conversation to reduce mental health stigma at work.\\nHeart & Soul Ambassadors\\nOur network of Heart & Soul Ambassadors is key to implementing our global strategy across the business. Our 70 Ambassadors in 2022, up from 60 in 2021, spread Heart & Soul’s message in their offices or business units, acting as human touchpoints for anyone who needs mental health support. They have the budget, autonomy, and trust to drive initiatives that are relevant for the location or business unit they support, and are in alignment with the global strategy.\\n“Heart & Soul just expands the space of dialogue, of potential things that are OK to say or issues that are OK to raise at work.\\nWe’ve trained most of our Ambassadors in Mental Health First Aid (MHFA). That means they know how to spot and support colleagues who may be struggling with their mental health, and can connect them with the support they need.\\nWe suggest our Ambassadors give an average of two hours of their working week to Heart & Soul, avoiding more time to prevent burnout. Every Ambassador’s manager supports them in this mission.\\nBeing a Heart & Soul Ambassador means being more exposed to complex topics and conversations that are not always easy to navigate without training. We want to ensure that our employee volunteers feel supported in their role. That’s why we not only train them in MHFA, but also provide continuous learning moments and space for reflection and connection within the Ambassador team. On a monthly basis, we offer Ambassador Circles hosted by our mental health partners on specific topics. We’ve been running these sessions since 2020, and the Ambassador team really appreciates them. In addition, we offer all Ambassadors unlimited access to counseling.\\nOur mental health partners team\\nIn 2020, we formed an external mental health partners team. It consists of mental health professionals from Singapore, the U.K., and the U.S., and it acts as an advisory board.\\nThe purpose of the partners team is to consult the Heart & Soul leads, provide external mental health trends from the regions where the partners are based, and develop programming and resources, as well as safety-check communications.\\n— Heart & Soul BU Ambassador, Sweden\\nEquity & Impact Report 2022                                   Introduction\\nClimate Action\\nDiversity, Equity, Inclusion & Belonging\\nMental Health\\nCivic & Community Engagement\\nResponsible Business & Governance\\nReporting Principles & Data\\nHow Spotifiers Can Access\\nMental Health Support\\nHeart & Soul Ambassadors\\nAccess to Mental Health Support\\nDomestic Abuse Support Program\\nTuning In to Our Spotifiers\\nKey Learnings\\nSupporting Our Listeners\\nAll the Feels Employee Assistance Program Through our All the Feels Employee Assistance Program (EAP), we offer short-term counseling from third-party mental health care professionals to all Spotifiers and their dependents ages 16 and older. Anyone can access up to five sessions per issue per year. Issues include relationships and parenting, stress and anxiety, major life changes, and surviving loss.\\nDuring 2022, the Heart & Soul team has continued to keep awareness high about All the Feels. In 2022 we saw approximately 7% of our employees (which can include employees' dependents or family members) taking advantage of the program. In addition to All the Feels, we also offer comprehensive medical insurance, which includes long-term therapy.\\nPremium access to Headspace app\\nWe give every Spotifier free premium access to Headspace, an easy-to-use meditation app.\\nHeart & Soul programming\\nThe Heart & Soul team curates a range of workshops, fireside chats, and panels delivered locally and\\nglobally, as well as the Heart & Soul podcast. Subjects are wide-ranging and include PTSD, postpartum depression, imposter syndrome, and domestic abuse. The programming also creates opportunities for colleagues to share with one another their mental health stories, which resonate powerfully with Spotifiers around the world.\\nWellness Week\\nIn late 2022, we celebrated our second annual Wellness Week, during which the whole company shuts down to allow Spotifiers to rest, restore, and recharge in whatever way works for them.\\nGuides for managers\\nWe want our managers to feel confident about, and capable of, talking with their team members about mental health. We provide guidance to help managers recognize common signs of mental health struggles and to know what support to offer.\\nUnderstanding boundaries\\nWith so many of us working from home, we need to set boundaries to help us avoid anxiety, fatigue, and\\nNovember\\nWellness Week\\nburnout. Our Understanding Boundaries resource provides all Spotifiers with knowledge, evidence, and tips for healthy boundary setting.\\nSubstance Awareness & Support Program\\nWe launched our Global Substance Awareness & Support Program in September 2022. The program provides resources and tools to help individuals seek help, make a change, or support someone else.\\nIn collaboration with mental health experts and partners, we invited all employees to participate in this carefully curated and compassionate program, which focuses on alcohol, drugs, and over-the-counter or prescription medications.\\nThe program offers recommendations and resource library, a collection of talks and webinars from our partners, and a Language and Attitude Guide to help everyone communicate more mindfully on this issue. This initiative helps us all become better allies to those struggling, and it plays an active role in creating inclusive teams.\\nHeart & Soul Domestic\\nAbuse Support Program\\nDomestic abuse is more prevalent than many realize. An average of 1 in 3 women and 1 in 6 men experience domestic violence in their lifetime.1 And the problem intensified during COVID-19. In nearly 54% of cases, domestic abuse continues at or near work, for example, via abusive texts and emails. This directly impacts the safety and well-being of victims and those around them.\\nHowever, the workplace can also represent a refuge where those affected can seek help safely, maintain financial stability, and regain self-worth. Only 5% of organizations have a domestic abuse policy. That means that while 82% of victims disclose their abuse to a coworker, their colleagues may not know how to help.2\\nAt Spotify, we believe violence and abuse is unacceptable. Our Domestic Abuse Support Program, launched in 2022, will help us better understand, recognize, and effectively respond to domestic abuse.\\nThrough the program, we provide training on how to identify the signs of domestic abuse and respond with appropriate support; plus, we have a directory of organizations that can help. We also support all Spotifiers affected by domestic abuse through the following initiatives:\\nMacGregor, J. C. D., Wathen, C. N., Olszowy, L., Saxton, M., & MacQuarrie, B.J. (2016). Gender differences in workplace disclosure and supports for domestic violence: Results of a pan-Canadian survey. Violence and Victims, 31(6), 1135-1154\\nOffice for National Statistics (2020).

This gives us invaluable insights into our\\nperformance on a range of mental health and well-\\nbeing issues.\\nIn September 2022, we received a response rate\\nof 82% to Tune-In. Using a 0-to-100 scale, where\\n0 = strongly disagree and 100 = strongly agree, we\\nsaw that Spotifiers strongly agreed (score of 88) that\\nSpotify advocates for positive mental health and well-\\nbeing. And we saw a 5% increase in this score from\\nMarch 2022 to September 2022.\\nSurvey respondents also said they felt comfortable\\napproaching their managers for support regarding\\ntheir mental health (83). Across the last three survey\\ncycles, this score has increased by about 1%. We were\\nalso pleased to see Spotifiers reporting a strong sense\\nof belonging at Spotify (74) in 2022.\\nOur Key Learnings About Mental Health at Spotify\\nWhen trying to drive behavioral and cultural change, we recognize that approach and mindset can\\nbe the difference between box-ticking activities and positive impact. We take an evidence-based approach to mental health, which helps build trust among our employees.\\nHowever, this doesn’t mean we always know what will work. We learn by doing. And this is what we’ve learned so far:\\nPosition mental health strategy within diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging Underrepresented communities are disproportionately affected by mental health issues. The work involved in creating and delivering our Heart & Soul strategy has helped us improve our diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging work. For example, it has facilitated more open conversations— both internally and externally—about topical events during times of unprecedented global social change.\\nKeep equity in the forefront Mental health resources aren’t always equitable, and access to professional support varies. For example, there’s a shortage of therapists from underrepresented communities. We always keep equity front of mind while designing our support and resources.\\nGather a team of ambassadors to promote your message\\nAs a global company, we might have been able to spread the Heart & Soul message, but the actual implementation happens thanks to our Ambassadors. Having people on the ground who can drive change with localized initiatives has been essential.\\nGet buy-in from the leadership team We anchored our strategy by finding senior advocates within Spotify. When our leadership team stood onstage and spoke about their own mental health experiences, it raised the profile of our message across the company.\\nEmbrace discomfort\\nWe knew that talking about mental health would create uncomfortable conversations. Rather than avoiding this, we tried to prepare ourselves as well as possible, and we gave people the time and space they needed to adjust.\\nDrive change through a strategy, not a program\\nBy making Heart & Soul a strategy, rather than a program with beginning and end dates, we have baked it into Spotify culture for the long term.\\nLean on partners\\nThe Heart & Soul team is not made up of mental health specialists. We draw on external experts who can give Spotifiers evidence-based information in a digestible format.\\nListen\\nWe listen to our employees before we roll anything out, while we’re implementing, and then again after. We also listen to our colleagues in Human Resources, who have their ears to the organization. And finally, we stay tuned to the external environment.\\nWellness hub\\nSupporting the Mental\\nHealth of Listeners\\nMusic and podcasts can provide invaluable help and inspiration to those facing mental health struggles. We seek to support our listeners through the following activities.\\nThe Mental Health hub\\nWhen someone performs a high-risk search on our platform, a message directs users to the Mental Health hub, where they’re connected with an easy-to-navigate list of local resources. This online hub, with support from the global youth charity Ditch the Label, makes it easier for our listeners and creators to find help.\\nMental Health moments\\nIn 2022, we leveraged several key moments to open up the mental health conversation among our employees and users. This typically involved sharing\\nmessages on our platform that click through to a\\nresource hub on the relevant issue. We’ve started\\nmeasuring the impact of these moments by tracking\\nhow many people click through and engage with the\\ncontent we’ve shared.\\nWorld Mental Health Day\\nFor 2022’s World Mental Health Day, we invited\\nlisteners to turn down the noise and tune in to\\nthemselves. Through on- and off-platform messaging\\nand partnerships with artists and creators, we\\npointed people toward our . There, we\\nhighlighted new playlists and revamped content on a\\nwide range of mental health topics.\\nThe World Mental Health Day campaign was live in\\n23 markets, including Sweden, India, Canada, Taiwan,\\nand Thailand.\\n05.\\nCivic & Community\\nEngagement\\nCivic & Community Engagement continues to be a critical\\naspect of our social impact work. As our world experiences\\nunprecedented shifts, our commitment to making a positive\\nsocial impact grows ever stronger. As a global platform, we\\nare strongly positioned to show up in a meaningful way for\\npeople, culture, the audio industry, and our employees.\\nMedia Responsibility & Impact\\nFor Spotify, media responsibility means supercharging the impact of our audio platform through accurate, trustworthy, and progressive storytelling. We prioritize stories from historically marginalized communities and focus on issues that resonate with our listeners. We do this by:\\nIncreasing the reach of potentially impactful content.\\nConnecting stories to opportunities for listeners to take real action.\\nShowcasing positive depictions of historically marginalized and underrepresented communities in order to shift narratives.\\nPodcast\\nKim Kardashian’s\\nThe System\\nA Spotify Original podcast, shines a light on the issues of racial discrimination in the American justice system. The podcast takes a deep dive into the case of Kevin Keith, who has spent 28 years in prison despite there being no physical evidence linking him to the triple homicide he’s serving time for. This true crime series reaches a huge audience\\nPodcast\\nHeather McGhee’s\\nThe Sum of Us\\nA Spotify Original podcast in partnership with Higher Ground, takes a tour of the United States while documenting stories of hope and solidarity in a time of great division and peril for democracy. We worked with Color of\\nChange to create a robust resource guide  to serve as a companion to this podcast.\\nPodcast\\nQuiet Part Loud\\nA Spotify Exclusive by Jordan Peele’s Monkeypaw Productions, is a scripted series that follows a fear-mongering and xenophobic radio host who, years later, is offered a bargain for vindication. We partnered with the Muslim Public Affairs Council, which received a grant from Spotify to further its work in fighting anti-Muslim hate, and are exploring additional ways to use the show to drive action in 2023.\\nCreating impact through storytelling\\nOur media responsibility work centers on providing support to Spotify’s storytellers to help them deliver greater positive impact. Through our podcast impact programs, we work with existing podcasts that are using the power of story to shine a spotlight on an issue or community, and are building campaigns that empower inspired listeners to learn more and take action on the relevant issues. In 2022, we launched three podcast impact programs to accompany three of our high-profile podcasts.\\nand raises important questions about racial inequality in legal systems—questions many listeners may never have engaged with before. We partnered with Color of Change, a U.S.-based nonprofit civil rights advocacy organization, to create tools for listeners who want to learn more and find ways to take action on criminal justice reform.\\nListen now\\nListen now                                 Listen now\\n“Color of Change is proud to be a Social Impact partner for Spotify, offering listeners tangible actions they can take to address the issues raised in the storytelling they listen to. It’s not enough to tell stories about the issues that impact our society; projects like Heather McGhee’s The Sum of Us podcast allow listeners to move from passive to active, giving people real ways to take action and demand change. When we work together, anything is possible.\\nKelle Rozell, Chief Marketing & Storytelling Officer at Color of Change\\nEncouraging Users to Participate In\\nthe Democratic Process\\nOur mission is simple: Help our consumers, creators, and employees feel empowered to vote while providing real, actionable solutions to the problems faced by voters. To do that, we bring messages about civic engagement to our audience wherever they are, from the voices they trust the most. Our campaigns are nonpartisan and focus on making voting easier and more exciting for our audience.\\nWe’ve been running voter engagement campaigns since 2016. While we initially focused our efforts on the U.S. and the EU, we’ve expanded into more countries every year. We’ve now reached nearly\\n57 million listeners worldwide, encouraging people globally to play their part in their local elections. Since we started our efforts, these campaigns have driven nearly 4 million visits to resources on civic engagement, such as helping users check their voter status, register to vote, or learn more about their local elections.\\nWhy do we care about voting?\\nSpotify is all about the power of voices being heard, so encouraging our listeners, employees, and creators to get loud about civic engagement makes perfect sense. No matter what issues they’re passionate about, showing up to the polls to make sure their voices are heard is essential. As a global audio platform with a huge reach, Spotify has the responsibility and the opportunity to encourage people to vote and to do our best to make sure no one’s left out of the process.\\nOur global and in-market teams work together closely to build campaigns that are culturally relevant and speak to the market’s electoral environment. For each of our campaigns, we produce locally relevant information that’s focused on overcoming barriers to voting by, for instance, explaining how it works, how to register, and where to go. Where possible, we also prioritize reaching people who may be interested in voting but need a little extra help to get to the polls.\\nWe focus our civic engagement efforts on those areas where we can make the most impact. That means looking for opportunities where we can move the needle and actually increase voter engagement.\\nTesting and improving our approach\\nThe electoral landscape is always changing, and we use that as an opportunity to test and pilot our engagement programs. For example, in the U.S. in 2022, we hosted a forum for artists and podcasters to learn how they can use their platforms for civic engagement.\\nBy empowering them with credible information from external partners and with advice on how to start the conversation, we were able to make them more confident in engaging in this space. We plan to build on this program in future civic engagement campaigns.\\nOur guiding principles\\nDrive action, not just awareness.\\nStay nonpartisan in an increasingly divisive environment.\\nReach less-likely voters where they are by engaging trusted voices.\\nCivic engagement efforts\\nNext page\\nOur 2022 Civic\\nEngagement Efforts\\nIn 2022, we ran civic engagement campaigns in five countries: Brazil, the U.S., France, Italy, and Sweden. Our messaging reached nearly 57 million listeners, with nearly 4 million resources on voting accessed as a result. Our campaigns primarily targeted Gen Z listeners, as many of them were making their electoral debut.\\nOur 2022 U.S. midterm elections campaign was our most successful campaign to date. Building on our 2020 U.S. election campaign, which targeted first-time voters, this time we focused on helping second-time voters return to the polls. Leveraging in-app notifications, a hub featuring podcasts about the election, an original playlist, social media, and more, our listeners accessed nearly\\n4 million election resources. This, in turn, led to at least 84,000 concrete voting actions, including registrations, plans to vote, and reviews of state information. We’re proud to have played a part in contributing to the estimated 27% of young\\npeople who participated in these critical elections to make it the second-highest youth midterms turnout ever.\\nOur pilot poll worker program\\nBecause every market has different needs, there are unique ways we, as a community of creators, listeners, and employees, can be useful.\\nPoll workers are an essential part of democracy in the United States, helping to ensure the voting process goes smoothly on the big day. A shortage of poll workers can lead to long queues and confusion among voters, all of which potentially reduces turnout.\\nIn the U.S. in 2022, we launched a program to encourage Spotify employees to volunteer as poll workers. With our support, Spotifiers signed up to become poll workers across 42 cities and 21 states.\\nInevitable Foundation\\nSpotify Pulse Fellowship\\nPhilanthropic Work & Employee Engagement\\nGiving plays a critical role in our integrated approach to impact and sustainability. It’s imperative that our external philanthropy work aligns with our internal work on climate action, civic engagement, mental health, employee well-being, and gender and racial equity. This year, we committed over $10 million to support nonprofits around the world through our employee match program and corporate grantmaking.\\nSupporting NGOs through employee matching and strategic grantmaking\\nThis year, we supported over 3,400 nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). While our grantmaking is mostly focused on assisting existing programs, we did create powerful bespoke programs with our nonprofit partners, including the following:\\nUNICEF and Ukraine\\nIn October 2022, Spotify and UNICEF embarked on a multiyear partnership that will explore innovative ways to use digital media and the power of music and audio to support the mental health and well-being of young people and their caregivers, including those affected by war.\\nTogether, we’ll also explore ways in which these innovative approaches can alleviate mental health distress and promote psychosocial well-being in the\\nFunding Racial Equity\\nOver 20% of our committed funds supported organizations championing racial equity.\\nlong term for young people around the world, starting with Ukrainian youth and refugees and expanding to other communities in the near future.\\nInevitable Foundation\\nSpotify partnered with the\\nto launch Elevate for Podcasters, a program that empowers professional podcasters with disabilities\\n“Wewant to create a world where disabled storytellers are able to create projects about anything they want, regardless of whether their stories contemplate disability, which is only one part of their complex identities.

And because creative thinking is at its best when pulled from a variety of backgrounds and experiences, unleashing the full scope of creative potential at Spotify means giving as many people as possible a seat at the table.\\nThat’s why we partnered with the 4A’s Foundation\\nto launch the  : a co-created,\\nyear-long creative development program for Black professionals with one to three years of professional experience in the advertising industry. To bring it to life, we partner with programs that are already doing inspiring work supporting, developing, and empowering Black creatives, like MAIP  (Multicultural Advertising Internship Program)\\nD&AD Shift    Marcus Graham Project    ONE School\\nand our newest program partner  BLAC Internship  .\\nTapping into organizations already created for and by Black creatives is key to finding talent for the Spotify PULSE Program.

Together, we can do so much more.\\nSpotify Gives Back\\nOur internal program Spotify Gives Back enables employees to contribute to causes they care about and amplify the positive impact of their activities. For us, supercharging the charitable impact that Spotifiers can make is one way we foster a sense of belonging within the company and wider community.\\nThrough this program, Spotifiers can support their favorite nonprofit organizations and participate in company-wide community impact activities.\\nIn 2022 over 52% of employees participated in our Spotify Gives Back program. They supported over 3,400 NGOs and clocked in over 3,000 volunteer hours.\\nGiving Tuesday\\nFor our second annual Giving Tuesday global campaign, we seeded all full- and part-time employees with $100 to support global or local nonprofit organizations, allowing them to participate in giving without having to use their own money. In addition, we matched all employee (non-seeded money) donations 2:1.\\nWe partnered with our diversity, equity, inclusion & belonging community groups to create a custom list of NGOs doing great work for their communities so that employees could make a direct donation. Any seed funds not earmarked by employees were distributed among the group of organizations. No waste, and maximum impact!\\nDonations Matching\\nSpotify matches donations made to eligible charities either on a 1:1 or 2:1 basis. Every full-and part-time employee has the ability to have up to $15,000 in donations matched by Spotify.\\nEach employee has one paid day a year to volunteer at a nonprofit of their choice.\\nDollars for Doers\\nSpotifiers who volunteer with eligible organizations earn a donation for their service.\\n06.\\nResponsible Business\\n& Governance\\nAs part of our commitment to running a responsible\\nbusiness that lives up to the highest ethical standards, we\\napply sound governance practices and have adopted several\\npolicies to support our company values and stakeholder\\ninterests.\\nOur Business Model\\nSpotify has transformed the way the world accesses and enjoys music and podcasts. Today, millions\\nof people around the world have access to over 100 million tracks and 5 million podcast titles. And during 2022, we rolled out the beginnings of our audiobooks offering in select markets where people now have access to more than 300,000 audiobooks.\\nYet Spotify is more than an audio streaming service. We are in the discovery business. Every day, fans from around the world trust our brand to guide them to entertainment that they would never have discovered on their own.\\nIf discovery drives customer satisfaction and delight, and customer satisfaction and delight drive engagement, and engagement drives discovery, we believe Spotify wins, and so do our users and the creators who connect with fans through our platform.\\nWe’re continuing to build a two-sided marketplace for\\nusers and creators that leverages our relationships,\\ndata analytics, and software.

It’s a broader conception of materiality than may be used in other situations. The process typically involves reviewing and aligning business priorities with topics that are most important to internal and external stakeholders. This helps businesses make more informed decisions.\\nWe conduct materiality analysis based on world events and on feedback from our employees, investors, financial analysts, and advertisers, as well as the media. Other external stakeholders we take into account include creators, users, suppliers, and the communities we operate in. We also consider legal requirements\\nDiversity, equity, inclusion & belonging\\nDiversity, equity, inclusion & belonging drives our success. Our extensive, continuous work in this area allows us to better serve our employees, creators, and users, and\\nto foster an environment of creativity and collaboration.\\n2. Climate impact\\nOur goal for net-zero emissions by the end of 2030 will require ongoing progress across a broad range of initiatives. Although most of our emissions fall outside our direct control, we can influence wider change in our supply chain, in our industry, and among our millions of users.\\nSustainable business practices\\nWe are committed to doing business in a sustainable way. That includes ensuring that social and environmental issues are integrated in our risk process and ensuring that third parties act consistently with our expectations and values.\\non non-financial reporting such as the Swedish Annual Accounts Act and the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) when conducting this analysis.\\nContent & moderation policy\\nOur long-standing Platform Rules help make Spotify a destination where everyone has a safe and enjoyable experience.\\nData protection & privacy\\nWe want everyone who uses Spotify to know their data is safe and respected by us and to feel confident and in control of the data they share with us. Maintaining this trust retains users and protects us from regulatory and reputational risk.\\nEthical business practices, including the prevention of corruption\\nWe continue to clearly communicate our expectations for ethical business conduct, particularly concerning bribery and corruption, to our employees and supply chain partners.\\nRisk Management\\nEquity & Impact Report 2022\\nDuring 2022, we assessed high-level risks to our business through our Enterprise Risk Management Program. Those assessed include the ESG risks identified as higher priority in our ESG materiality assessment. We created a management-level Enterprise Risk Committee with cross-functional representation, which reports quarterly to the Audit Committee.\\nIn 2023, our management, led by our Risk Advisory team, will continue to enhance our risk management processes, policies, and tools.\\nDisclosure requirements\\nBusiness Model\\nRisks\\nPolicies\\nPerformance Indicators\\nSpotify Response\\nKey aspects of the Spotify business model are described in the report.\\nWe report our most material impacts with respect to the areas mentioned in the legislation:\\nEnvironment: Energy use, greenhouse gasses, and sustainable materials\\nEmployees: Diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging, nondiscrimination, implementation and communication of corporate values and ethics\\nSocial matters: Content responsibility\\nHuman rights: Data privacy\\nAnti-corruption: Business ethics\\nWe consider these impacts to correspond with the most significant risks for Spotify and/or stakeholders.\\nWe have addressed how we manage these impacts and risks throughout the report.\\nWe have policies, or a position and management approach, in place for most of the areas and impacts and risks mentioned above. With regard to our environmental impact, although not a formal policy, we have developed a strategy aimed at achieving our targets of net-zero emissions.\\nOur priorities and activities in each area are reported in relevant sections of the report.\\nWe report measures of performance of each impact and risk mentioned above, where relevant data is available.\\nThe performance indicators are reported in each section of the report, and details on data collection procedures are presented in the chapter of Reporting Principles & Data.\\nSection in Report\\nResponsible Business & Governance\\nClimate Action\\nDiversity, Equity, Inclusion & Belonging\\nMental Health\\nCivic & Community Engagement\\nResponsible Business & Governance\\nClimate Action\\nDiversity, Equity, Inclusion & Belonging\\nMental Health\\nCivic & Community Engagement\\nResponsible Business & Governance\\nThis is Spotify  Climate Action  Diversity, Equity, Inclusion & Belonging  Civic & Community Engagement  Responsible Business & Governance\\nMental Health    Reporting Principles\\nContent Actions\\nPlatform Rules\\nCreating a Safe, Secure &\\nTransparent Platform\\nWe’re aware of the impact our platform can have on people, society, and the world. Spotify is committed to making sure our platform is safe for both our listeners and creators.\\nWe understand our responsibility in handling data from users, creators, and employees, and we’re proactive when it comes to content moderation and policy, data protection, and privacy. We describe our approach in the following sections.\\nOur Platform Rules\\nWe welcome all different kinds of ideas, perspectives, voices, and artistic expression. Inevitably, there will be some content on our platform that individuals don’t like, or that Spotify doesn’t endorse. However, that doesn’t mean that “anything goes”. It’s important that our creators are aware of what is not allowed on Spotify. For that reason, in 2022, we published our long-standing Platform Rules, which help ensure that everyone has a safe and enjoyable experience on Spotify.\\nThe  were developed by internal\\nteams in concert with global external safety experts to address dangerous, deceptive, sensitive, and illegal content. They are not static: the abuse landscape constantly evolves, and our rules must evolve along with it.\\nAll content is subject to the same rules and enforcement actions. As outlined in our\\narticle, Spotify may take a variety of actions on content, including removing violative content from our platform. Repeated or egregious violations of our Platform Rules may result in accounts’ being suspended and/or terminated.\\nIn 2022, we explored how best to highlight our rules in our creator and publisher tools by providing an in-product notification linking to the Platform Rules and encouraging creators to read them. This helps creators understand their accountability for the content they post on our platform.\\nLaunch of the Safety Advisory Council\\nIn 2022, Spotify took another step in our commitment to improving platform safety and transparency: the establishment of the Spotify Safety Advisory Council SAC  . Management established the SAC as a dedicated body to help our various business teams inform and evolve our policies and products in a\\nway that keeps our users safe while making sure we respect creator expression.\\nThe Spotify SAC is globally focused, with each member bringing a distinct expertise on the online safety space. Council members advise our teams in key areas like developing policy and safety features, and they help inform our approach to equity, impact, and academic research. While members don’t make specific enforcement decisions, they help shape the policies and processes we use to keep our platform consistently safe.\\nSAC is also the first safety-focused council of its kind at any major audio company. While we’ve worked closely with many of the council’s founding members for years, we’re excited to deepen our relationship with them to expand and evolve the SAC in the months and years ahead.\\nCreating a Safe, Secure &\\nTransparent Platform\\nData protection and privacy\\nWe’re committed to data protection because we believe privacy is a fundamental human right. As part of this commitment, we regularly update our\\nPrivacy Policy   and\\tPrivacy Center   to ensure they\\ncomprehensively describe data processing at Spotify in simple and accessible language. We want everyone using our services to understand what data we collect, how we use and protect it, and what their rights and controls are over it.\\nAll our users have access to a suite of tools to exercise their privacy rights, as well as a knowledgeable staff of advisors to answer their questions about data processing at Spotify. In 2022, we enhanced our “Download your data” tool, making it easier for our users to identify and download a comprehensive set of their personal data, or just the particular types they’re interested in. This past year, almost 800,000 people used the “Download your data” tool to download their account data.\\nWe prioritize the protection of user data from unauthorized use and inappropriate disclosure, and we follow a formal incident response process to identify and respond to data security incidents. In 2022, our Data Protection Office identified two incidents that met the reporting threshold for security incidents under relevant data protection laws, and these were reported to the appropriate privacy regulators.\\nAcquisition of Kinzen\\nIn 2022, we made strides to further improve our ability to detect and address abusive content and misinformation with the acquisition of Kinzen, a global leader in protecting online communities.\\nKinzen’s technology combines machine learning and human expertise—backed by analysis from leading local academics and journalists based in countries around the world—to analyze potential harmful content and hate speech in multiple languages and countries.\\nWe’ll use Kinzen’s insights, together with feedback from\\nexperts on our Safety Advisory Council, to continue\\ndeveloping local guidelines for tackling misinformation.\\nContinuing to combat misinformation about\\nCOVID-19\\nTwo years on from creating the COVID-19 hub for\\nsharing trusted, up-to-date news about the pandemic,\\nwe’re still learning and working to build ever-more-\\nrobust processes and systems to better serve our\\nlisteners.\\nOne of our key interventions in 2022 was the rollout\\nof a content advisory label on podcasts that discuss\\nCOVID-19. This label connects interested listeners\\nwith more information about COVID-19. We also\\npublished our Platform Rules policy on content that\\npromotes dangerously false or dangerously deceptive\\nmedical information.\\nSpotify Research\\nAlgorithmic Impact\\nUnderstanding the impact our algorithms have on the listeners and creators we serve is core to our business and product success. We evaluate, and mitigate against, potential algorithmic inequities and harms, and we strive for more transparency about our impact.\\nWe have a dedicated company-wide effort on algorithmic responsibility. The effort includes policy, algorithmic assessment, and work with product teams, as well as governance and support infrastructure.\\nOur Spotify Algorithmic Policy, Guidelines, and Best Practices, which was implemented in 2021, continues to provide our teams with centralized guidance on facilitating safer approaches to personalization, data usage, content recommendation, and discovery.\\nOur approach\\nOur investment into improving our algorithmic impact comes in three parts: direct work with product teams to better assess and address our impact, research and case studies, and external collaboration and\\nengagement with communities and researchers outside the company, including Spotify’s Safety Advisory Council.\\nCross-functional collaboration\\nIn 2022, we published an overview of our Algorithmic Impact Assessment AIA  process, which we’ve used to assess over 100 internal systems. The process helps us implement policy and serves as an instrument for teams to self-assess where there may be potential harms to listeners or creators.\\nThe policy also creates space for teams to further investigate potential inequitable outcomes for creators and communities by providing guidelines and best practices to mitigate algorithmic harms.\\nBeyond this, our collaboration with specific product teams continues to allow us to create more granular guidance. We ask teams to evaluate existing or potential algorithmic harms, such as stereotyping, and provide customized guidance based on the recommendations found through the assessment process.\\nResearch and case studies\\nWhile industry methods and guidance in this space are still limited, we continue to collaborate with teams across the company, translate new research from the wider research community into Spotify-specific approaches, and develop additional tools and playbooks to fill gaps.\\nIndustry standards are evolving, and we continue to develop methods to advance responsible product development. We also share our research into algorithmic responsibility on Algorithmic\\nResponsibility  .\\nExternal collaboration\\nSpotify is part of a broader industry conversation about algorithmic responsibility, impact, and accountability, and these past years we’ve contributed to external events such as FaCCT, NeurIPS, and\\nthe T&S Research Conference. In academic and industry forums, we share our best practices, and we learn from others and apply those insights, including through establishing structures internally to operationalize algorithmic responsibility.\\nBusiness Ethics\\nOur values are designed to build and maintain trust among our employees and with those outside the company, such as our users, creators, advertisers, and partners. One of our key values is sincerity. It drives us to do the right thing, be nice, and play fair. We strive every day to conduct business ethically.\\nIn addition, our community is committed to cultivating an environment where: 1) employees are not subjected to discrimination or harassment of any kind, and 2) employees feel comfortable raising concerns about such issues without fear of facing retaliation or reprisal. This commitment ensures we treat others with respect and promotes a safe workplace where all of us can thrive.\\nPolicies and standards\\nThese values are cemented through our Code of Conduct and Ethics (Code), which provides an overview of what we expect from our employees in terms of ethical behavior. We require respect for and compliance with laws, rules, and regulations.\\nThis is reinforced by robust ethical policies and procedures, including our prohibition of bribery and corruption; conflicts of interest; discrimination, harassment, and retaliation; the misuse of data; insider trading; and supplier misconduct. Through our Code and policies, we also prohibit all forms of human trafficking, slavery, servitude, and forced or compulsory labor in our business and supply chain.\\nAll Spotifiers are prompted to annually review and acknowledge their compliance with the Code and with many of these key global policies (“Global Policy Review”). This exercise is reinforced by accompanying training videos (including an anti-corruption video training) and messaging from senior leadership. By the end of 2022, 97% of Spotifiers completed their assigned Global Policy Review (company departures excluded), and the final 3%, often employees on leave, have a follow-up to prompt completion. All new Spotifiers are also expected to complete review of these global policies within their first 30 days of hire and confirm their commitment to abide by policies prohibiting corruption, discrimination, and harassment.\\nSpotify Ethics Line\\nBusiness Ethics\\nSpotify Ethics Line\\nThe ability of Spotifiers to raise compliance concerns comfortably, without fear of reprisal, is essential to conducting our business with honesty, integrity, and fairness.\\nThese concerns could be anything relating to compliance with our Code, employee policies, and the law, and could span issues such as workplace harassment and discrimination, conflicts of interest, and suspicions of theft, bribery, or fraud.\\nWe’ve made it a point to offer multiple ways to raise concerns so that employees can pick the path that feels most comfortable to them. Options include communicating with their manager, Human Resources, through a mailbox to a cross-functional team that helps with ethical conduct inquiries, or through our Legal department (which includes our Compliance and Employment Law teams).\\nAdditionally, our  is available to\\nall employees and others for raising compliance\\nconcerns. It’s hosted by a third-party whistleblower hotline and web interface that sends concerns to the appropriate teams for handling. It provides options to submit concerns either by web, phone, or SMS (in North America), and, where applicable, to route a concern through a local reporting tier. Our Spotify Ethics Line is governed by our Whistleblower Policy, which is subject to oversight by our Audit Committee.\\nSupplier responsibility\\nAt Spotify, we want to be as open and transparent\\nwith our business partners as possible while being\\nresponsible for where and how we source services.\\nOur Supplier Code of Conduct\\tSCoC    defines\\nthe basic expectations of our suppliers’ and third-\\nparty intermediaries’ responsibilities toward their\\nstakeholders and the environment. Our SCoC and\\nstatement concerning modern slavery underscore our\\ncommitment to high ethical standards for our supply\\nchain and to the promotion of fair and safe\\nworking conditions.\\nWe are committed to doing business ethically,\\nand that includes ensuring that third parties act\\nconsistently with our expectations and values. As a\\nresult, several teams partner to review our third-party\\nrelationships based on their risk profiles. This is done\\nto drive compliance with our policies—including our\\nSCoC—and with laws that are designed to prevent\\nbribery, corruption, fraud, money laundering, and\\nterrorism financing and promote the protection of\\nprivacy, information security, and user safety.\\n07.\\nReporting Principles & Data\\nAbout This Report & Reporting Principles\\nThis is Spotify AB’s sixth Equity & Impact Report and refers to the financial year 2022 from the months of January through December. While this report brings the opportunity to share our work, our progress, and our commitments to push ourselves to be better every year, it also fulfills disclosure requirements from the Swedish Annual Accounts Act (implementing EU Directive 2014/95 regarding disclosure of non-financial information).\\nThe report covers Spotify AB (corporate ID no. 556703-7485), subsidiary of Spotify Technology S.A., headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden, and all other subsidiaries as per Note 12 of the Spotify AB annual financial statements, unless otherwise noted in this report. In signing the annual financial statements, the Board of Directors of Spotify AB has also approved the Equity & Impact Report.\\nData Appendix\\nThis data appendix consists of additional information\\non data and KPIs. The information aims to provide\\nstakeholders and readers with supplementary ESG\\ninformation in order to gain a deeper understanding of\\nthe company’s activities and operations.\\nOur People\\nMethod(s) for data collection\\nEmployee data is collected and stored in Spotify’s HR system. The data is compiled on an annual basis. Figures include permanent and fixed-term contracted employees. More detailed data on Spotify’s Board of Directors can be found on investors.spotify.com  .\\nEthnicity (US employees only) **\\n*\\nReported number for 2020 has been recalculated to reflect only permanent employees, excluding 421 consultants.\\nOur numbers reflect U.S. employees who have declared their ethnicity (approximately 94%).\\n7.8%\\n8.3%\\n19.0%\\nNot previously reported\\nNot previously reported\\nNot previously reported\\nClimate Data\\nMethod for collecting climate data and calculating GHG emissions\\nThe climate impact is measured using a combination of activity and spend data to calculate emissions results, and the methodology has been refined throughout the year. The calculations follow the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard and the Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard. Emissions in the report are presented in metric tons of CO₂e.\\nFor Scopes 1 and 2, a combination of data from third-party utility bills (natural gas, electricity) and estimated usage based on office square footage (where actual data is not available) is used. A market-based approach has been applied, and these emissions are calculated using contract-specific emissions factors where available, data on grid-residual emissions factors, or location-based emissions factors where there are no contracts or residual emissions factors. Location-based emissions are calculated using the emissions intensity of the relevant grid region and that approach results in\\n98,502 t CO₂e higher GHG emissions for Spotify in\\n2022.\\nScope 3 emissions are primarily calculated using spend as a proxy and applying industry standard (or supplier-specific, where available) emissions factors to monthly spend data. Certain Scope 3 subcategories such as business travel-related emissions, are based on activity data (e.g. flight logs obtained from travel agents). Because we’re committed to accuracy\\nand transparency, we will continue to refine our methodology and sources of data, focusing on\\nfrom estimating buildings emissions from square footage estimation to utility bills, improved input data granularity.\\nMethodology changes\\n(the methodologies applied to activity data between measurements)\\n•\\tChanges in climate science, e.g., the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) regularly updates its estimate of the warming potential of non-CO₂ greenhouse cases, changing the CO₂ equivalent values of those emissions;\\nkey areas of our Scope 3 emissions, such as cloud computing and end use .\\nChanges in Spotify’s 2022 GHG emissions can be attributed to activity changes and/or methodology changes including updated emission factors. See below for examples of such changes in 2022.\\nActivity changes\\nIncreases or decreases in activity, e.g., purchasing more IT equipment, resulting in higher emissions intensity from IT equipment;\\nMixshifts in activity, e.g., employees’ moving to a region that has a cleaner grid, resulting in lower work-from-home office emissions intensity;\\nChanges in activity measurement type, e.g., moving\\n• Market and societal developments, e.g. the U.S.\\nDepartment of Energy’s Buildings Performance\\nDatabase’s 2021 version shows that buildings have\\nbecome more efficient on average, using less\\nelectricity and natural gas per square foot;\\n• Improvements in GHG emission accounting\\nmethodologies,e.g., adding vendor-specific\\nemissions factors based on newly reported data.\\nEmissions factors have also been updated based on improved availability of suppliers’ reported emissions via the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP).\\nGovernance Data\\nMethod(s) for data collection\\nData on data privacy is measured and tracked by the Data Protection team. Data on algorithmic impact and responsibility is measured and tracked by the Algorithmic Impact & Responsibility team.\\n*\\nNumber of employees confirmed to have read and agreed to follow key global policies during 2022 through the “Annual Policy Review and Confirmation” process (company departures excluded). The final 3%, often employees on leave, have a follow-up to prompt completion.\\nAuditor’s report\\nNext page\\nAuditor’s Report On the\\nStatutory Sustainability\\nStatement\\nTo the general meeting of the shareholders of Spotify AB, corporate identity number 556703-7485.\\nEngagement and responsibility\\nIt is the Board of Directors who is responsible for the statutory sustainability statement for the year 2022 and that it has been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act.\\nThe scope of the audit\\nOur examination has been conducted in accordance with FAR’s auditing standard RevR 12 The auditor’s opinion regarding the statutory sustainability statement. This means that our examination of the corporate governance statement is different and substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in\\naccordance with International Standards on Auditing\\nand generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden.\\nWe believe that the examination has provided us with\\nsufficient basis for our opinions.\\nOpinions\\nA statutory sustainability statement has been\\nprepared.\\nStockholm March 22, 2023\\nAndreas Nyberg Selvring\\nAuthorized Public Accountant\\nErnst & Young AB\\nNotes & Disclaimers\\nThe statements, estimates, projections, guidance\\nor outlook contained in this report include\\n“forward-looking” statements that are intended\\nto take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions\\nof the federal securities law.

       "\"OVERVIEW 2022\\n\\nNotes relating to forward-looking statements\\n\\nThis document contains statements about the future business development and strategic direction of the Company. The forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and assumptions. They are subject to certain risks and fluctuations as described in other publications, in particular in the risk and opportunities management section of the combined management report. If these expectations and assumptions do not apply or if unforeseen risks arise, the actual course of business may differ significantly from the expected developments. We therefore assume no liability for the accuracy of these forecasts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThese sections contain content or cross-references not required by law, which were not audited by the auditor, but were merely read critically. In the case of cross- references, the information to which the cross- references refer was also not audited.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n➔HUBERT HINTERSEHER\\n\\nCHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER PUMA\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn 2022, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine required PUMA to be flexible and pragmatic. The health and safety of our PUMA Family was our top priority, while we executed our strategy to become the world’s fastest sports brand and continued our strong growth momentum.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom the outset of the war in Ukraine, we focused on our employees, athletes and other partners, providing safe accommodation and welcoming many PUMA employees and their families in Germany and Poland, where we also helped arranging work permits and jobs.\\n\\nWe were impressed by the actions taken by our PUMA Family. Colleagues in Poland and Hungary waited at the borders to bring PUMA employees and ambassadors from Ukraine to safety. Others from our HQ in Herzogenaurach drove to Ukraine to\\n\\n\\n\\nbring necessities such as food and clothes to help those who had stayed in the country. We also gathered product donations for aid organizations in Ukraine to get help to those who needed it most.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor our efforts to provide an attractive workplace, PUMA was named a Top Employer 2022 in several regions of the world, including Europe and Asia/Pacific. We were listed by Forbes among the World’s Best Employers and by the Financial Times as a Leader in Diversity for Europe. In Germany, we were named “Company of the Year” at the German Diversity Awards and in Mexico we were among the best places to work for women in Expansión’s ranking “Súper Empresas Para Mujeres”.\\n\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic eased in Europe and the Americas, but the situation for our store network and our supply chain remained challenging in parts of Asia, especially in China, where our employees did an exceptional job despite the repeated lockdowns. The tireless work of our sourcing teams ensured that supply chain disruptions were kept to a minimum throughout the year.\\n\\nPUMA’s brand heat was boosted further by the great performances of our athletes, who underscored our credibility as a sports brand. At the World Athletics Championships in Eugene, Oregon, USA, Jamaican sprinter Shericka Jackson ran the second fastest 200m time in history, while Swedish pole vaulter Armand “Mondo” Duplantis set yet another world record of 6.21 meters and was named “World Athlete of the Year.” Another gold went to Portuguese athlete Pedro Pichardo in the triple jump with the best performance of the year.\\n\\nOur Ukrainian PUMA athlete Yaroslava Mahuchikh won the gold in the high jump at the World Indoor Championships in Belgrade, Serbia and the European Championships in Munich, Germany. Her win in Belgrade was a very emotional moment, after she took a difficult three-day journey by car at the start of the war in Ukraine to travel to the event in Serbia.\\n\\n\\n\\nOur athletes relied on the latest versions of our evoSPEED NITRO spikes, which are made with PUMA’s NITRO-Technology and a PWRPLATE for extraordinary energy return. NITRO is also an important part of our newest product line-up for long- distance and road running, such as the futuristic FAST-R NITRO Elite and the DEVIATE NITRO ELITE 2.\\n\\nWe also added to our roster of international top athletes in road running, by signing Norwegian Sondre Moen and US athlete Jenny Simpson.\\n\\nIn Football, our PUMA Team Morocco sensationally reached the semifinal of the World Cup in Qatar. Our players Antoine Griezmann, Olivier Giroud and Raphaël\\n\\n\\n\\nVarane were in the French starting line-up in the final. Neymar Jr. scored his 77th goal for the Brazilian national team, equaling the record of football icon Pelé.\\n\\nAhead of the tournament, we kicked off the “Generation Fearless” campaign, as part of which our global teamsport ambassadors presented our new ULTRA and the FUTURE 1.4 football boots.\\n\\nThe Women’s Euro in England confirmed the increasing popularity of women’s football in all markets. With Austria, Iceland, Italy and Switzerland, PUMA had four teams at the tournament and also generated great visibility with the more than 70 players who played in our boots. We equipped our players and teams with special collections and supported them with marketing campaigns ahead of the tournament.\\n\\n\\n\\nAmong club teams, PUMA teams AC Milan and Manchester City both won the title and Olympique de Marseille and Borussia Dortmund came in second in their respective leagues. In the Netherlands, PSV Eindhoven won the Dutch Cup. At the end of the season, PUMA secured a long-term contract extension with AC Milan and became the official match ball provider of the Italian football league Serie A, starting from the 2022/23 season.\\n\\nIn North America, PUMA works with LaMelo Ball, one of the most successful players in the NBA, and we created the very successful signature shoes MB.01 and MB.02 with him, which are sold exclusively at our strategic retail partner Foot Locker. Our basketball athlete Marcus Smart was named NBA Defensive Player of the Year while Jackie Young became the most improved player of the year in the WNBA. We expanded our roster of Basketball ambassadors with new signings such as Mikey Williams, Scoot Henderson and NaLyssa Smith.\\n\\nIn Golf, Cobra PUMA Golf athlete Ewen Ferguson won the Commercial Bank Qatar Masters and the ISPS Handa World Invitational, while Olivia Cowan claimed her maiden Ladies European Tour Victory in India at the Hero Women’s Open. Lexi Thompson took the trophy at the Aramaco series in NYC and once again joined the champions circle. Anna Nordqvist won in the The Netherlands and brought home the Big Green Egg Open. Finally, Justin Suh took his first win at the Korn Ferry Tour Championship, which paved his way onto the PGA Tour and gives him a spot in 2023 at The Players Championship and at the US Open.\\n\\nIn Motorsport, Red Bull Racing driver Max Verstappen secured another Formula 1 Drivers’ Championship, as PUMA supplied the three most successful teams in the sport: Scuderia Ferrari, Oracle Red Bull Racing and Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1. We benefited from the increasing popularity of the sport, especially in the United\\n\\n\\n\\nStates, where Miami hosted its first Grand Prix in 2022, which was immediately sold out.\\n\\n\\n\\nDuring our return to New York Fashion Week, our spectacular FUTROGRADE show included a digital Web3 experience. The runway show was curated by PUMA Creative Director June Ambrose and special appearances on the catwalk by our ambassadors such as Usain Bolt, Winnie Harlow and Yaroslava Mahuchikh created a lot of buzz in the press and on social media. With the FUTROGRADE event, we showed that the virtual world is becoming increasingly relevant for our young audience.\\n\\nIn 2022, we also unveiled our largest Web3 collaboration to date with 10KTF and launched “PUMA and the Land of Games” on the online gaming platform Roblox. We used the Roblox experience for a unique launch event, as we first presented Manchester City’s new third kit in “PUMA and the Land of Games”, giving players the first opportunity to explore and interact with the new kit in the virtual world.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn 2022, we launched our PUMA Shopping App in India, the United States, the UK and Japan. The app allows consumers to virtually try on selected products before they buy, see what the products look like in sophisticated 3D animations and make purchases. PUMA further strengthened its distribution by entering new markets with the PUMA.com online store in the Philippines, Thailand, Peru, Norway, Saudi Arabia and several other new countries in the Middle East and Africa.\\n\\nWe announced a long-term partnership with British-Nigerian rapper, and record producer Skepta, who will design product and be a part of global marketing campaigns. Deals with pop stars Eleni Foureira from Greece and Teodora from Serbia underlined our focus on local relevance to reach audiences around the world.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn September, we invited industry peers, activists, NGOs, experts, ambassadors, and consumers to London for our sustainability event Conference of the People, an open conversation about sustainability, which put the concerns of Gen Z at the center of the debate. It gave us the opportunity to explain our sustainability work in great detail, including the RE:SUEDE and RE:JERSEY circularity projects. For RE:SUEDE, we distributed 500 experimental pairs of our iconic SUEDE sneaker to consumers in Germany, who tested them for half a year before returning them, so we can establish whether the sneakers can be biodegraded in a controlled industrial setting. The RE:JERSEY recycling project was unveiled in partnership with our football teams Manchester City, AC Milan, Borussia Dortmund, Olympique de Marseille and Girona. In this project, we trial a chemical recycling process,\\n\\n\\n\\nwhich can turn old polyester garments into new polyester yarn and even deal with logos, embroideries and club badges. We expect to scale up the use of this chemical recycling process in the coming years.\""
